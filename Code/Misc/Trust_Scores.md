# Trust Models in VANETs:

Trust models in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) assess the reliability of network entities to ensure secure communication. Key trust models include:

- **Entity-Based Trust:** Evaluates the trustworthiness of individual vehicles based on past behavior, communication patterns, packet delivery ratios, and adherence to protocols. This model allows for detailed trust assessment and identification of malicious entities.

- **Data-Centric Trust:** Focuses on the credibility of exchanged information rather than individual entities, using digital signatures, hash functions, and reputation systems to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

- **Hybrid Trust:** Combines entity-based and data-centric trust approaches for a comprehensive evaluation, enhancing overall trust assessment by integrating both entity reputation and data credibility. This model offers a balanced and adaptable trust management system for VANETs.
