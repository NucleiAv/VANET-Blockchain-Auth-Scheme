In VANETs, On-Board Units (OBUs) benefit from ample power, enabling advanced computational capabilities that can also facilitate complex attacks. Unlike traditional mobile devices, OBUs can support intensive attacks due to their high processing power. VANETs face unique security challenges due to their characteristics, including high mobility, dynamic topology, short connection durations, and frequent disconnections. These challenges lead to issues in trust group formation, position detection, and certificate management. Attacks in VANETs are classified based on their impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA), as well as on authentication and accountability. A cryptographic-based categorization is proposed for its simplicity and alignment with traditional network security approaches.
