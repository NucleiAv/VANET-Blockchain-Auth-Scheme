# Contributions
The contributions of this article/paper are as follows - 
1. **Inter-Platoon Communication Protocol**: We propose a novel protocol that enables seamless vehicle coordination for tasks like lane changes, accident prevention, and traffic management. This addresses a key gap in VANET schemes, allowing vehicles to operate cohesively without RSUs.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Our model introduces detailed event logging within the VANET system, enhancing transparency by tracking command execution and outcomes.

3. **Large Vehicle Dynamics Management**: Specialized protocols are introduced to manage large vehicle dynamics, improving traffic safety and efficiency.

4. **Advanced Traffic Management**: Our approach integrates advanced lane management, dynamic obstacle detection, and adaptive speed regulation to handle complex traffic conditions effectively.
