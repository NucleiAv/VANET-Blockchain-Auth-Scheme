Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) primarily aim to enhance road safety by minimizing accidents, which in turn improves traffic conditions and saves lives. Besides safety, VANETs offer a variety of services such as internet access, weather updates, and geo-location information, adding comfort, convenience, and entertainment to the travel experience.

VANETs are guided by several standards, including IEEE 1609.x, 802.11p, and Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE). WAVE, built on a layered architecture, enables devices compliant with IEEE 802.11 to operate in the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) band. The IEEE 1609 family specifies the architecture, protocol set, and interfaces, focusing on secure message exchange to ensure interoperability in VANET environments.

The VANET architecture includes On-Board Units (OBUs) in vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) along roads, though RSUs are less emphasized in newer models. VANET communication is categorized into Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) interactions. Nodes, which represent vehicles or roadside equipment, use DSRC channels for communication.

Trust management is vital in VANETs for verifying the reliability of vehicles and the messages they exchange, thereby preventing false emergency alerts. While reputation certificates and digital signatures are promising approaches, many current schemes neglect privacy preservation, a critical issue due to the risk of disclosing sensitive information. Effective privacy preservation should address anonymity, unlinkability, and traceability while integrating with trust management.
