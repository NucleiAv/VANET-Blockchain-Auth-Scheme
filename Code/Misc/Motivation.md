# Motivation
The development of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) is essential for the future of intelligent transportation systems, aiming to improve road safety, traffic management, and operational efficiency. The thesis "Secure Blockchains for Cyber-Physical Systems" introduced a blockchain-based approach to securing VANETs by utilizing the concept of platoons and the removal of RSUs (Road Side Units) - a mechanism that is one of a kind and had never been proposed before. However, it left several critical areas unaddressed. These gaps motivated us to build on this unique concept, addressing its shortcomings to make the existing scheme even more robust. Our proposed improvements aim to fill these voids, ensuring a more secure, efficient, and scalable VANET system. By incorporating comprehensive inter-platoon communication, dynamic trust management, and advanced traffic handling protocols, our model represents a significant advancement in the field of vehicular networks, paving the way for more reliable and safer smart transportation systems.
