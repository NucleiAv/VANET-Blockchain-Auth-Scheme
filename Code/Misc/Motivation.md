# Motivation
The thesis "Secure Blockchains for Cyber-Physical Systems" introduced a pioneering blockchain-based approach to securing VANETs by utilizing platoons and eliminating RSUs. However, it left critical gaps unaddressed, particularly the lack of inter-platoon communication, inadequate management of large vehicle dynamics, and insufficient traffic handling protocols. These shortcomings motivated us to enhance the existing scheme by introducing robust inter-platoon communication, dynamic trust management, and advanced traffic management features, making the system more secure, efficient, and scalable for intelligent transportation.
