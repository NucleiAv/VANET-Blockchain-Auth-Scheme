Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) have been extensively researched to enhance road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall driving conditions. Traditional VANET models utilize both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, with Roadside Units (RSUs) playing a crucial role in maintaining network infrastructure and facilitating data exchange between vehicles and centralized systems (Lu et al., 2018; Wagner, 2020). However, these models can be costly due to the deployment and maintenance of RSUs, which also present potential vulnerabilities as centralized points of failure.

To address these limitations, platooning has emerged as a promising alternative, significantly reducing operational costs by eliminating the need for RSUs. In a platoon-based model, vehicles travel closely together, which minimizes aerodynamic drag and decreases fuel consumption due to slipstream effects (Wagner, 2020). This model focuses solely on inter-vehicle communication, effectively bypassing the need for extensive infrastructure while still achieving efficient data exchange and improved driving safety.

While several studies have explored the implementation of intra-platoon communication, where vehicles within a platoon exchange information to maintain formation and safety, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding inter-platoon communication. Inter-platoon communication is crucial for scenarios such as accident avoidance or the management of speeding vehicles. In the event of an accident, effective inter-platoon communication can provide timely alerts to nearby platoons, allowing them to adjust their speeds or change lanes to avoid collisions. Similarly, in scenarios involving speeding vehicles, inter-platoon communication can help manage traffic flow by dynamically adjusting the speed of multiple platoons to ensure safety and efficiency (Wagner, 2020).

Matthew Edward Wagner's thesis on "Secure Blockchains for Cyber-Physical Systems" introduces a blockchain-based model for VANETs that focuses on intra-platoon communication, ensuring secure and efficient data sharing among vehicles within the same platoon. However, Wagner's work does not extend to inter-platoon communication, which is critical for comprehensive traffic management and safety in real-world scenarios (Wagner, 2020). This oversight highlights the need for further research into optimizing communication protocols for scenarios where multiple platoons interact, such as during emergencies or high-speed maneuvers.

The current literature underscores the need for a decentralized approach that minimizes reliance on RSUs while maintaining robust communication between vehicles and platoons. Future research should focus on developing efficient inter-platoon communication mechanisms to enhance the overall functionality and safety of VANETs. By leveraging decentralized technologies, it is possible to create a more resilient network that can dynamically adapt to changing traffic conditions without the need for centralized control points.

In conclusion, while the platooning model offers significant advantages in terms of cost and efficiency, particularly in fuel savings and reduced infrastructure requirements, the lack of inter-platoon communication capabilities remains a critical gap. Addressing this gap is essential for the development of a fully autonomous and integrated VANET system that can handle diverse traffic scenarios and enhance road safety for all users.
