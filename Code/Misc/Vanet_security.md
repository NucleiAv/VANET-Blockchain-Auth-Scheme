Smart vehicles in a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) are designed to enhance driving safety and efficiency through several key features. They are equipped with basic sensors like front and rear radar to gather additional information from their surroundings that drivers might miss. Positioning systems such as GPS are essential for accurate navigation and driving assistance. These vehicles also have advanced communication systems with multiple interfaces, a central computing unit, and an Event Recording Device (ERD) similar to an aircraft's black box, which records crucial data for post-incident analysis.

Safety in VANETs is paramount due to the direct risk to human lives. Unlike traditional networks, where confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the main concerns, VANETs focus on ensuring vital information remains unaltered and promptly delivered. The network's dynamic nature, with frequent vehicle arrivals and departures, short connection durations, and reliance on wireless communication, adds complexity to maintaining security, making VANETs susceptible to attacks that could have serious or even fatal consequences.
